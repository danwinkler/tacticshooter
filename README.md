To build:
`gradle clean build bundleNative`

The relevant JRE needs to be in that folder

You'll then need to copy over the necessary files into that folder


Map Review:
battlefield1 - Against AI, not fun at all. The AI sucks.
battleifled2 - Against AI, pretty uninteresting against AI.
The_Complex - Against AI, I feel like the AI doesn't play this one well. I think if the AI got a bit better it would be more fun.
map1 - Against AI, too small, deadlocky, not enough income to do anything. (Deleted)


Idea: AI should coordinate with each other to decide who should be offensive and defensive. Offensive players would be similar to current AI, but defensive players would identify the frontline and reinforce it.
